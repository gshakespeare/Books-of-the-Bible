# 📖 Bible Data Analytics Project

Welcome to my data analytics project on the **Books of the Bible**! This project uses Excel to explore and visualize structured data about each book in the Bible.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

I organized each book by:

* 📚 **Book Name**
* 🏷️ **Genre Type** (e.g., History, Poetry, Prophecy)
* 🗣️ **Original Language** (Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic)
* ✡️ **Hebrew Name & Meaning**
* 🇬🇷 **Greek Name & Meaning**
* 🔢 **Chapters, Verses, and Book Count**
* ✍️ **Author/Writer**
* 👥 **Original Audience**
* 📅 **Date Written**
* 📍 **Location Written**

## 📊 Visualizations

To bring the data to life, I added:

* Charts showing genre distribution
* Graphs comparing chapter & verse counts
* Language usage breakdowns
* Timeline visuals of when the books were written

## 🧠 Summary

At the end, I included a written summary that highlights interesting patterns and insights found in the data.

## 💻 Tools Used

* **Excel** – for data organization and visualization
* **Charts & Graphs** – built-in Excel tools
